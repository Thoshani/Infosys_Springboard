# Milestone 1 Project

##  Project Overview

This project is part of **Milestone 1**. It demonstrates the process of **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation**.

##  Installation & Setup

Make sure you have the following installed:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Open the notebook using Jupyter:


jupyter notebook final.ipynb


##  Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Run the notebook step by step to reproduce results.

##  Project Workflow

* Data loading
* Data cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering
* Model Training
* Model Evaluation

##  Results & Insights

The notebook demonstrates the training and evaluation of ML models, with performance metrics and visualizations. Key insights are derived from the dataset to understand patterns and improve predictions.

##  Future Improvements
