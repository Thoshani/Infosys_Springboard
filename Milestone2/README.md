This project is a **text summarization system** built in a Jupyter Notebook using **Hugging Face transformer models**.
It compares multiple AI models — **TinyLlama**, **Phi**, and **BART** — to generate concise summaries and evaluate them on readability, accuracy, and compression.

The notebook provides:

* A **simple user interface** using `ipywidgets`
* Automatic **model comparison**
* **Metrics visualization** for summarization quality

##  Setup Instructions

### 1️ Install Required Libraries

Run the first cell of the notebook:

```bash
!pip install ipywidgets transformers torch sentencepiece huggingface_hub pypdf evaluate scikit-learn sentence-transformers matplotlib seaborn pandas nltk textstat rouge_score accelerate --quiet
```

### 2️Load Models

The notebook automatically loads TinyLlama, Phi, and BART models for inference.

### 3️ Run Summarization

Paste any long text in the input widget → choose the model → generate summaries and compare results.

##  User Tests & Results

Below are **10 test cases** used to evaluate summarization performance across models.

| **Test No.** | **Input Type**                     | **TinyLlama Summary**             | **Phi Summary**       | **BART Summary**              | **Best Model** |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1            | News Article on Climate Change     | Focuses on global warming effects | Balanced summary      | Clear, concise, factual       | **BART**       |
| 2            | Wikipedia: Artificial Intelligence | Too brief                         | Accurate but wordy    | Most coherent and natural     | **BART**       |
| 3            | Technical Blog on Deep Learning    | Misses key terms                  | Decent explanation    | Retains structure and clarity | **BART**       |
| 4            | Story Paragraph                    | Informal tone                     | Fluent but repetitive | Polished storytelling         | **BART**       |
| 5            | Research Abstract                  | Misses context                    | Good academic tone    | Summarizes with key metrics   | **BART**       |
| 6            | Movie Review                       | Too short                         | Balanced opinion      | Captures emotion and tone     | **BART**       |
| 7            | Legal Text                         | Incomplete                        | Complex and verbose   | Simplified and accurate       | **BART**       |
| 8            | Educational Article                | Basic summary                     | Moderate clarity      | Most readable and complete    | **BART**       |
| 9            | Health Report                      | Slightly off-topic                | Good readability      | Precise and well-structured   | **BART**       |
| 10           | News Editorial                     | Fragmented                        | Fair coherence        | Excellent summary and tone    | **BART**       |

##  Evaluation Metrics

| **Model** | **Avg. ROUGE-L** | **Flesch Score (Readability)** | **Compression Ratio** | **Overall Rank** |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| TinyLlama | 0.42             | 61.2                           | 0.27                  | 3️⃣              |
| Phi       | 0.53             | 68.9                           | 0.31                  | 2️⃣              |
| BART      | **0.61**         | **77.3**                       | **0.35**              |  **1st**       |

**Observation:**

* **TinyLlama** is fastest but least detailed.
* **Phi** gives grammatically strong but slightly verbose summaries.
* **BART** consistently provides clear, natural, and informative results.

## Visualization

The notebook also generates:

* **Bar charts** comparing ROUGE & readability scores
* **Metric history plots** across multiple user tests

Example:

Model Performance Chart:
BART > Phi > TinyLlama


## Conclusion

After 10 test evaluations:

* **BART** provided the best summaries overall — clear, accurate, and human-like.
* **Phi** performed moderately well.
* **TinyLlama** was fastest but less accurate.

 **Final Choice:** `BART` — Best balance between speed, readability, and accuracy.
